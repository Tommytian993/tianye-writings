Stream Psych Sci-fi -  Story Summery:

			     Little Patroller in Dreamland 
⛰️Background:
The narrator is a university student, who attempts suicide after a crisis (possibly a breakup or emotional turmoil) and is sent to a psychiatric hospital.

At the hospital, he meets the protagonist - a mysterious boy (let's call him Boy A)—quiet, he has black eye circles, always tired, he said he is the Dream Patroller around the area, every night he help resolve other mental patients and even doctors’ psychological conflicts, in their dreams.

Boy A tells him that he got here because he killed his cousin(“Teddy Bear” Ted), and from there the story of dreams, demons, and missions begins to unfold.


🛣️Boy A’s Story Begins: 
Boy A is secretly a dream detective/dream patroller, chosen by a mysterious figure known as the “Dream Envoy.”


The Dream Envoy tells him that a true Sleep Demon is hiding in human dreams, but its identity is unknown, it might be someone close to him.


Boy A is tasked with completing a series of dream missions to prove he’s worthy of chasing the Sleep Demon.


Each mission takes place inside someone else's dream, and his goal is to resolve that dreamer’s psychological or existential conflict.


The Three major dream quests🏹:
🟠 Mission One – The Looping Dream Boy (Boy B) – Failed Mission💀:
Reality of Boy B: Suffering in real life—abusive family, bullied at school, psychiatric meds, overall bleak life.


His Dream: A fabricated, beautiful school life with close friends and a girl who likes him.


The Twist: Boy A enters what he assumes is reality, but it’s actually Boy B’s constructed dream world.


Leakage Begins: The dream starts bleeding reality—e.g., the girl shows that she don’t remember him. Boy B assumes it’s a series of connected dreams, but it’s actually reality resurfacing.


Tragedy: Believing it’s “just another dream,” Boy B jumps from a high place to “wake up,” but he dies in real life.


Boy A fails his first mission—this is a major emotional and psychological turning point.


📌 This first failure is crucial to Boy A’s growth and his understanding of the blurred line between dream and reality.

🟡 Mission Two – The Alchemist in the Castle (a dream of a coma patient)🏯:
Boy A enters a fantasy world filled with castles, corruption, propaganda, and magical medicine.


Dream figure: an alchemist who distributes potions that erase memory and dreams.


In reality: the alchemist is a scientist from a vaccine company involved in unethical experiments. He’s now in a coma, and his subconscious reflects guilt and internal conflict.


Boy A deciphers the symbolism, understands the dreamer’s torment, and successfully helps him reconcile his moral dissonance.


This is Boy A’s first successful mission.


📌 This mission blends allegory, social commentary, and dream logic in one arc.

🔴   Final Mission – The True Nature of Boy A’ cousin, Ted 🔪
Ted is Boy A’s closet companion—cousin, friend, or peer.


Ted is outgoing and happy all the time, even at night in dreams. Unlike other boys who always have nightmares, he had vivid, heroic dreams of slaying monsters and saving worlds.


The truth: The dreams were portals to other dimensions, and the “monsters” were living beings from alien worlds or alternate realities.


Ted is not a hero—he is the true Sleep Demon, committing mass killings across realities in his sleep.


Boy A, understanding the horror of the situation, kills Ted for the greater good. (After inner struggle, stabs him to death on the bed)


As a result, he’s deemed mentally ill and confined to the hospital.


📌 This is not a twist but a revelation. The central theme is that dreams have real consequences—even interdimensional ones—and justice is ambiguous.

Helping out other patients in the hospital
The boy told college student, he helped a lot of peer patients since he’s been here, he went into their dreams and cured them from their dream core.

1: The volcano dream🌋 - A patient in the hospital who suppressed his anger too much, the boy help cause a eruption of the volcano, so he got cured.

2: The aquarium dream🐳 - A old man in a coma at the hospital, the aquarium contain water of his memories. 

3: The TV📺 - A patient locked inside a TV with rapidly switching channels, he is addicted to social media, the boy helped him break free.

4: The endless doors🚪 - The patient had lots of imagination of what his life could be, the lives are behind each door, the boy found the real one and it lead to himself.

5: The burning diary📓 - A patient who kept writing a diary in her dream, every written page burns, the boy helped her relieve childhood trauma.

Helping out the Doctor and Nurses at the Hospital
1: 🎭The boy helps out the doctor, his dream is a experiment factory, where he can wear masks and feel all the twisted painful emotions. In real life, the doctor is trying to understand patients and he is emotionally burned out but hides it under professionalism.


2: 🏥The boy helps out the nurse, her dream is in a donation charity center, where she had to donate her emotions, it signifies her caring too much about patients and suppressing her own emotions. The boy in the dream taught her to donate something different, in turn helped her learn self-erasure.

The Ending:
Before the college student left the hospital, the boy confessed being sorry about killing the sleep demon - his cousin, even it was the right thing to do to protect other worldly creatures, but as a friend and relative, he failed to do the correct thing as a former companion. 

The Epilogue:
NEU college student Tianye Wang sighed, and submitted the story online, finally finished this creative writing assignment! This whole thing, going to the hospital, meeting the boy and stuff, was actually inspired by a dream he had last week.

Tianye casually clicked on one of his classmate’s comment, and froze in shock - 
“Wait... what? I saw him too last time I went to Boston Behavioral Center”  wrote the comment. “The boy with the strange eyes, he told me the same story. I thought he was just another insane.”

Tianye slammed the laptop shut. Outside his dorm window, the sky was dark — too dark for 3 p.m.




Author’s Note:
To produce this story took longer and more effort than I expected. At first the AI doesn’t seem to understand the correct logic of the plot I came up(maybe was my explanations). It got stuck at one point, I had to go to another model(claude.ai), try to convince it, and send its response chatgpt to clarify the whole thing(but it worked out in the end).

Just a description of the story plot, cus it might be a bit vague in the output - A college student went to a psychiatric hospital and met a boy who killed his cousin(out of good reason because he was the sleep demon), and during his time here he cured many patients and doctor’s mentality, via dream- which is the theme of my last reverse engineering prompt. I actually came up with this plot inspired by a recent book I read - “The Green Mile”, the main character is a inmate with superpower, with it he was able to helps out other prisoners and guards.

There are several very good outputs that surprised me: The scenes depicting how the boy helped out patients and doctors in the hospital.

Lastly, I really like one ending it suggested, so I incorporated into my draft.
